@app.callback decorator.  
That decorator is provided by Dash and is associated with the app object. 
 Within your app.layout, you can have one or several HTML controls, each with an ID.
In this case, you have just one, the dropdown. 
 When you use app.@callback, the function that follows (the function is update_graph() 
 in this case) will be called any time one of the controls that is specified as an Input
  for that callback has a change in value, that is, each time the user enters or clicks on something. 
   The changed value or, in the case of multiple Inputs, the changed values, are then passed to the decorated function.
     That function returns the Output, in this case a graph. 
      (It is also possible to have multiple Outputs for the callback, but that's beyond the scope of this lesson.) 
       You can have multiple @app.callback decorator statements within a Dash program, each decorating a different function. 
        So, for example, you could have several different graphs on the page, 
        each of which is controlled by a different set of HTML controls.
